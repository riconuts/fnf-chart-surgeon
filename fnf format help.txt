bpm:Float = 100;
crochet:Float = ((60 / bpm) * 1000); // beats in milliseconds
stepCrochet:Float = crochet / 4; // steps in milliseconds

sections by default are 4 beats long (16 steps)

Every note is an array that stores data like this:
    0: Strum time. (In milliseconds)
    1: The note data.
        (0: LEFT, 1: DOWN, 2: UP, 3, RIGHT) Player notes if the current section is a mustHitSection
        (4: LEFT, 5: DOWN, 6: UP, 7, RIGHT) Opponent notes if the current section is a mustHitSection
        If the note data is negative then Psych Engine treats the note as a GF note? (not tested)
    2: The sustain length.
    3: The note type.
